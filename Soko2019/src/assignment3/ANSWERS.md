--- Part 1 ---

--- Part 2 ---

For this part the game class from assignment 2 was used. Main class is interpreted as Game Class. The Sequenze Diagramm is saved as Assignment 3 Part 2

--- Part 3 ---

For Part 3, we decided to implement the adapter pattern.
Besides the Initialization of the new Pieces in the "board.java" file, 
we were able to implement the Superqueen and 
Archbishop WITHOUT ANY CHANGES IN THE EXISTING CODE!!! :) :) :)

As a consequence of your implementation in Assignment 2, not the "move" function itself had to be changed,
insted the "boolean[][] getPossibleFields*(board b)" needed to be adjusted.

Currently when you're playing the game, the Superqueens and Archbishops are 
initialized as a standart. As a consequence, the notation stays the same as it was before,
however now the additional fields on the board can be accessed as defined in the task.
